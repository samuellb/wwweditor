Backend-related:
  [ ] Create an interface for template systems
  [ ] Create an interface for versioning systems (not sure if this is
      acutally a good thing, I don't see any benefits of the alternatives
      to GIT (like SVN, Bazaar, etc))
  [ ] Move template/project stuff to a separate binary?

Parser(?):
  [ ] Ensure the output (input?) is always UTF-8:
        g_utf8_validate(s, NULL, NULL)
        conversion?
  [ ] How are comment handled in raw/rc-data?
  [X] Fix long comments with ">" inside.

Templates:
  [X] Implement template markers completely
  [ ] How to handle recursive templates?
  [X] Implement template updating

Projects:
  [ ] Add a function for getting the project info for a file
      (whether it's a template, and the template filename if any)
  [ ] Project file loading/saving
  [ ] Project loading in the UI
      [ ] Initialize a "new" project when there's no project file and import
          all .html (and image/stylesheet/javascript/related) files
  [X] Populating the file list
  [ ] Adding/removing files
  [X] Template editing. Make <body> an implicitly editable section?
  [ ] Load subdirectories on demand

Editor (C):
  [X] Saving files
  [X] Paragraph types
  [ ] Changing editable sections
  [ ] Styles
  [X] Free memory after gtk_tree_model_get, etc...
  [ ] Style tags (bold, italic, etc)
  [ ] Image insertion
  [ ] Audio and video insertion
  [ ] Drag and drop (image/*, audio/*, video/*)
  [ ] Table insertion
  [ ] What happens if something is inserted before the <!--@marker-->?
  [ ] Clean up the code (indentation, remove Apple-style-span, <h3><span style="font-...: normal">, etc.)
  [X] Clean up some aspects of the code live
  [ ] Javascript plugins/extensions?
  [X] Restore the selection after the element type is changed

Editor (JS):
  [ ] Make non-editable elements non-focusable (like <a>, <input>, <button>, etc.)
  [ ] Prevent normalization of:
      [ ] Entities, such as &shy;

User interface:
  [ ] Restore window size and position. Should be saved per computer/hostname
      in case they have different screen sizes.
